# This project was developed in my first 48-hour JAM carried out by ESAT for its second year students.

**My contributions to the project was**: 
  
  Moving blocks and breakable blocks with their effects
  
  The script and effects of the button and the ramp of the second level.
  
  And the script of an elevator that was not used due to lack of time for a third level
  
  Programming language: C#
